# Music-Genre-Classification
Music genre classification is a fundamental problem in the field of music information retrieval.

This project aims to classify music into different genres with the help of multiple popular classification algorithms like XGBoost, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc. A Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) has also been implemented to aid in predicting music genres for any given audio sample.

The audio data that has been used to train the classification algorithms as well as the neural network was obtained from the GTZAN dataset available on Kaggle.
